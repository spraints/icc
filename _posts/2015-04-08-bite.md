One morning, {{site.ricc}} and {{site.bicc}} were playing with ice blocks, when their parents said, "Time to go."

"Huh?" said {{site.ricc}}.

"Time. To. Go," said Father Ice Cream Cone.

"I'm gonna beat you to the car!" yelled {{site.bicc}}.

"No way!" shouted {{site.ricc}}, without getting up. {{site.bicc}} beat him to the car. "I wasn't racing," said {{site.ricc}}, when he finally got to the car.

Away they went in the car.

"{{site.ricc}} leave me alone!" yelled {{site.yicc}}.

Father said, "{{site.ricc}}, are you bothering your sister?"

Mother looked into the back seat and said, "{{site.ricc}}, you know the rule. There's a no-man's land between you and your sister. Right now your hand is past no-man's land and in her territory. She's allowed to bite you when you do that."

"Owwwww!" yelled {{site.ricc}} as {{site.yicc}} exercised her rights.

{{site.ricc}} said, "Knock knock!"

Father and mother heard only happy sounds for a while. Eventually, {{site.yicc}} started yelling unhappily, followed by a scream of pain from {{site.ricc}}.

"Did you put your hand in her space again, {{site.ricc}}?"

"Yeah."

"Are you going to do that again?"

"No."
