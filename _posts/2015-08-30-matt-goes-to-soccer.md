# STORY ONE

One morning, ricc woke up and said, "Oh what a glorious day!" bicc jumped into ricc's room and sang, "Because I'm happy! Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof!" ricc said, "Ugh!" and shoved him out and slammed the door. "I was happy," he muttered to himself. Through the door, he heard, "Because I'm happy! Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth!" ricc shook his head and opened a book.

Several hours later, ricc noticed that the house was really quiet. He opened his door and peeked outside. There was noone there. There was especially noone there trying to convince him that he was happy. Pfff, bicc. What a silly ice cream cone.

But where was everyone?

He looked in bicc's room. He looked in yicc's room. He looked in mother and father's room. He found nobody. He went downstairs and looked in the living room, the dining room, the kitchen, the sitting room, the office. He went outside and checked in the cool bots' shed. Sure enough, the cool bots were there, but where was his family? Maybe they went somewhere, why didn't they tell him where they were going? To check, he thought he'd look in the garage. Then he'd be able to see if any bikes or cars were missing.

He turned the door handle and opened the garage door. It was dark for a second...

AND THEN IT GOT REALLY BRIGHT! "HAPPY BIRTHDAY RED ICE CREAM CONE!!!" everyone shouted. Mother and father were there. bicc was there, yicc was there. And gicc and picc were there too! ricc had forgotten that it was his birthday! Can you believe it? Well, he really enjoyed that birthday party, and he even started singing, "Because I'm happy! Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do!"

# STORY THE SECOND

ricc and bicc were playing with ice blocks. They hadn't really made anything very interesting when all of a sudden the Ice Cream Cone Beacon shone in the sky. "Time to go!"

The mayor said, "Well, hello boys. How are you doing? Did you have a nice weekend?"

"Yes. Is there --"

"Oh, good. I had a very nice weekend too. My grandkids came over and had a snowball fight. I used to have snowball fights, but now I just watch. What did you do?"

"We had a snowball fight too," ricc said.

"That's wonderful," the mayor continued. "It sure is nice to have a snowball fight. I remember when --"

bicc interrupted. "Mr. Mayor, isn't there a crisis? Isn't that why you turned on the beacon?"

"What?" The mayor got a bit flustered. "Oh, yes, that's right. Over in West Iceville we think there's a hot bot."

"You *think* there's a hot bot?"

"Well, downtown iceville is -20 degrees, and west iceville just went up to -19.9 degrees."

"One tenth of a degree? You called us for one tenth of a degree?" ricc asked.

"Oh, not just that. Also the police told me that three buildings HAVE BEEN MELTED!!!"

bicc's eyes opened wide. "That sure sounds like a hot bot! ricc, let's go!"

They headed over to west iceville. When they got there, sure enough there was a hot bot. ricc turned on the hydraulic jammer, but it didn't stop the hot bot. bicc turned on the electromagnetic jammer, but it didn't stop the hot bot. ricc tried the bluetooth jammer, but the hot bot kept going. bicc tried the wifi jammer, still nothing. ricc was getting aggravated, so he reached into his tool box, grabbed the first thing he touched, and threw it at the hot bot. The tool landed in the left hip of the hot bot, and the hot bot fell all apart.

When they pulled the heat lamp out of the cockpit, he said, "You lousy kids just *had* to throw a monkey wrench in my plans, didn't you?"

# LAST STORY

Blasters blasted through the air. Light sabers sliced the debris. Bad guys were fighting good guys, and it looked like the bad guys had the upper hand.

ricc turned off the TV. "TV is so unrealistic," he announced. "It's nothing like real life."

"What do you mean?" bicc asked.

"I mean, the bad guys are always so dumb! Once we show up, it's only like two seconds before they're in the slammer and their junk is in the junk yard. Bad guys are super dumb."

bicc started to say, "Don't you remember that one time when," but he didn't finish, because there was a huge explosion outside! It sounded right outside the door! ricc and bicc both jumped.

They ran to the door and looked outside. Of course, by this time they were changed into their ninja suits. The front yard looked normal, so they continued out to the street. When they looked around, they saw a huge column of smoke rising a bit north of town. They rushed to their cool bots and headed off.

The radio in ricc's cool bot crackled, and he heard gicc's voice say, "ricc? Did you hear that? We're on our way to check it out!"

"Yep," ricc replied. "We're headed there too."

When they got north of town, they saw a huge crater where a large iceberg had once been. ricc said, "I'm going to get a closer look. I'll holler if I find anything." bicc, gicc, and picc spread out to investigate other areas.

Part way around the crater, ricc found a suspicious tunnel. He cautiously entered it. It was very dark in the tunnel, so he turned on the night vision system in his cool bot. There were no traps. After he'd gone around a couple of turns, he came to a dead end. He turned around and headed back out.

Suddenly a blinding light shone in the tunnel, and the sound of a light saber echoed around him. ricc grabbed his light saber and energized it. "You'll never escape, Hot Plate!"

"Muah. Ha. Ha. HA HA HA HA HAHAHAHAHA! *I'll* never escape? I'm right next to the mouth of the tunnel. You're backed into a corner, and the rock walls will block any radio signal you attempt to send. It looks more like you are the one who will never escape."

Hot Plate thrust at ricc. ricc parried. Hot Plate swung at ricc. ricc ducked, and Hot Plate's saber hit the wall, sending dust and rocks all over the cavern. For about 15 minutes, they battled. ricc was seriously doubting whether he would escape.

The blast that had opened the crater was super hot, and had melted a lot of ice. Some of the water had run into the tunnel. As Hot Plate and ricc battled, the water was freezing. ricc's cool bot had good treads on its feet for walking on any surface, especially on ice. But Hot Plate was still wearing sandals from Farthest India. He stepped on a fresh patch of ice, and slipped. ricc slice at Hot Plate's light saber and knocked it out of his hand. ricc picked up Hot Plate's light saber, and turned his own light saber off. The cavern got dark, and when he turned the night vision system back on, he was, once again, alone. ricc rushed to the opening of the tunnel and looked around, but Hot Plate was nowhere to be seen.

He called the other ninjas, and asked if they had seen Hot Plate. They said that they hadn't, but they'd heard a rocket. Hot Plate must have flown away. Rats!

bicc asked, "ricc, did you see Hot Plate?"

"Yeah."

"Is everything ok?"

"Yeah, everything's under control." ricc remembered earlier, when he had bragged about never being in trouble. "I was in a little bit of trouble, but it's all good now."
